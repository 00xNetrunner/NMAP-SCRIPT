# Nmap Automated Scan Script :computer:

## What is it? :mag_right:

This script automates the process of performing comprehensive network scans using `nmap`. It is designed to facilitate both TCP and UDP network scans on a list of IP addresses, generating detailed logs and reports of the network's status.

## What does it do? :gear:

The script accepts multiple IP addresses as arguments and performs the following actions for each IP:

- Executes a verbose TCP scan (`-sT`) over all TCP ports (1-65535), with additional `nmap` flags to detect service versions, operating system guesses, and runs standard scripts for banner grabbing, vulnerability detection, and exploitation where possible.
- Conducts a UDP scan (`-sU`) over a specified range of UDP ports (1-500), with verbose output, scan delay, and similar service and vulnerability scripts.
- Outputs scan results to individual timestamped files in both plain text `.txt` and XML `.xml` formats for further analysis.
- Logs the start and end of each scan, including any errors, to a consolidated log file with a unique timestamp.

## How to use it? :wrench:

To use this script, you need `nmap` installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it on most Linux distributions using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nmap
```

Once nmap is installed, you can run the script by passing the IP addresses as command-line arguments:
```bash
./nmapScan.sh <IP-address-1> [IP-address-2] ...
```

Ensure that the script has executable permissions:
```bash
chmod +x nmapScan.sh
```
